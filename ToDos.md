## To Dos

\*\*Needed to add "--openssl-legacy-provider" to react start and build scripts, app runs now. Need to research on what NPM packages need updating for React

\*\*As soon as possible, add comments to client side of app

1. Display "Reactions" under thoughts

2. Finish styling - need to better style the "Thoughts"

3. Find a better way to run - may need to rework thoughtControllers for querying thoughts from database by the thought id

4. Add more comments to organize code more neatly

5. Clean up unused code
